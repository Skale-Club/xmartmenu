# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-06)

**Core value:** A restaurant owner can go from zero to a live, shareable digital menu in under 10 minutes — no design skills, no developer needed.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — schema

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (schema) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Phase complete — all plans executed
Last activity: 2026-05-06

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (v1.1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0):**

- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: ~25 min
- Total execution time: ~2.5 hours

**By Phase (v1.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Performance | 2 | ~50 min | ~25 min |
| 2. Security | 3 | ~75 min | ~25 min |
| 3. CI/CD | 1 | ~25 min | ~25 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- In-memory cart (no localStorage) — matches skleanings pattern, avoids state-sync complexity
- Option groups for product variants — pizza sizes + half-and-half require structured groups, not flat addons
- CartContext must use 'use client' boundary — Next.js App Router constraint
- half_and_half price rule: max(half1.base_price, half2.base_price) — Brazilian convention
- [Phase 04]: Migration 021 does not touch orders_public_insert — already fixed in 020 with orders_enabled gate
- [Phase 04]: base_price nullable on product_options to distinguish absolute option price from additive price_modifier
- [Phase 04]: Status UPDATE rows before DROP+ADD CONSTRAINT to avoid CHECK constraint violation on existing data
- [Phase 04]: Order.status union uses kitchen workflow language: pending/preparing/ready/done/cancelled (not confirmed/completed)
- [Phase 04]: base_price vs price_modifier: base_price is absolute option price (nullable), price_modifier is additive delta (non-nullable)
